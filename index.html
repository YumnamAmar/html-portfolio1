    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to my website! My name is Y Amarjit Singh, and I’m thrilled to share a bit about myself with you. I’m 34 years old and come from the beautiful state of Assam. With a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Applications, I’ve spent the last decade building a rewarding career in IT, currently working as a Senior IT Engineer for a US-based company. I started my journey in 2014 as a Junior IT Engineer, and since then, my passion for coding and creating websites has only grown. When I’m not working, you’ll find me listening to classic Hindi music or spending quality time with my wonderful family, including my spouse and our two lovely children. Although my busy schedule often keeps me grounded, I have a deep love for travel and look forward to exploring new places whenever I get the chance. <br><br><br>
        
        Thank you for visiting—I hope you enjoy exploring the projects and insights I’ve shared here!</p> <br>
